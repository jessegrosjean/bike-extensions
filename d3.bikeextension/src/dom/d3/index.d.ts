	 * - %Q - milliseconds since UNIX epoch.
	 * - %s - seconds since UNIX epoch.
	 * - %S - second as a decimal number [00,61].
	 * - %u - Monday-based (ISO) weekday as a decimal number [1,7].

	 * This differs from the ISO week date specification (%V), which uses a more complicated definition!

	 * For %V,%g and %G, per the strftime man page:
	 *
	 * In this system, weeks start on a Monday, and are numbered from 01, for the first week, up to 52 or 53, for the last week.
	 * Week 1 is the first week where four or more days fall within the new year (or, synonymously, week 01 is: the first week of the year that contains a Thursday;
	 * or, the week that has 4 January in it). If the ISO week number belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used instead.
	 *
	 * The % sign indicating a directive may be immediately followed by a padding modifier:
	 *
	 * 1) 0 - zero-padding
	 * 2) _ - space-padding
	 * 3) - disable padding
	 *
	 * If no padding modifier is specified, the default is 0 for all directives except %e, which defaults to _.
	 * (In some implementations of strftime and strptime, a directive may include an optional field width or precision; this feature is not yet implemented.)
